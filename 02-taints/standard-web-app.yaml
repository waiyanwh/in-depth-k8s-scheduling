# Standard Web App - BLOCKED by taint
# This deployment targets production nodes but lacks the required toleration.
# Pods will remain Pending because they can't "cross the fence".
#
# Use case: Demonstrates what happens when a standard app tries to run
# on secure/restricted nodes without proper authorization.
