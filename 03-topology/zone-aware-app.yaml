# Zone-Aware App - Uses Topology Spread Constraints
# This deployment spreads pods evenly across availability zones.
# With maxSkew=1, the difference between zones can be at most 1 pod.
#
# Use case: High-availability applications that must survive zone failures
# by ensuring equal distribution across zones.
